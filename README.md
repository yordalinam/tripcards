🎨 Design Decisions
⏺️Sass @use modules - using variables (v.$purple-main) in every scss component
⏺️gap: 1rem - Consistent spacing system across flex/grid layouts
⏺️Hover lift effects - transform: translateY(-2px) + shadow
⏺️Portal modals - createPortal to #modal putside of the root
⏺️Replacement of some of the links to the cards api (the image link) with some of the already existing ones - as 4 or 5 of them gave back error 404 (missing resource)

Tradeoffs: 
⏺️There is no footer, routing, navigation - mainly because of the simplicuty of the website.
⏺️The lift effects on the cards could get a bit loafy on mobile 
⏺️custom scroll bars (using webkit) is generallly not a best practice as not all browser maintain it - in this project, I chose to do this for simplicity
⏺️did not exctract all the possible components - for example, the PrimaryButton component could have been made more flexible - to be used for the other buttons
across the website - in the modal, the sorting toggle etc.
